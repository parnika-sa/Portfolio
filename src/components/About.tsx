          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I specialize in backend operations and automation workflows that help businesses 
            scale efficiently. My work focuses on building reliable systems that minimize 
            manual effort and improve operational clarity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            With a methodical approach to problem-solving, I analyze existing workflows, 
            identify inefficiencies, and implement automation solutions that deliver 
            measurable results. Every project is built with scalability, reliability, 
            and maintainability in mind.
